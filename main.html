<h1>INDIA ON THE EVE OF MUGHAL CONQUEST</h1>
<p>India in the 16th century presented a picture of political disunity and disarray.</p>
<P>The Delhi Sultanate had shrunk in size and power, with several regions breaking free from its control.</P>
<P>The governor of Punjab, Daulat Khan Lodi, had declared his independence from the Delhi Sultanate; so had the governors of Bengal, Sindh, Multan and Jaunpur.</P>
<p>The rulers of Mewar, Malwa, Gujarat and Khandesh no longer owed allegiance to the Delhi Sultanate.</p>
<p>In the Deccan and the South, powerful regional kingdoms like the Bahamani kingdom and mighty Vijayanagara Empire ruled.</p>
<p>The Mughals were the powerful descendants of the Mongols. (Mughal is the Persian word for 'Mongol'.)</p>
<p>Under the inspired leadership of Babur, they took advantage og the absence of a strong central power to invade India and established Mughal  rule in Delhi.</p>
<p>The Mughal Empire in India lasted from the 16th century to mid 19th century CE, i.e., for around 250 years.</p>
<p>In the course of these 250 years, the Mughals expanded their empire to cover almost the whole of the Indian subcontinent and left a permanent mark on the society, culture, art and architecture of India.</p>
